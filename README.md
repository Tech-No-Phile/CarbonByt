## 📋 Usage
🌍 What Does CarbonByt Do?
 
Every time you visit a website, CarbonByt analyzes its HTML and textual content to estimate how much data is being transferred. This data (in bytes) is then converted into:

Gigabytes (GB) – to reflect the true data size more meaningfully

Kilograms (kg) of CO₂ equivalent – using carbon estimation models for data transmission and server usage
## 💡Why CarbonByt?

Most people don’t realize that internet usage consumes electricity—and data transfer, especially on large websites, contributes to CO₂ emissions. CarbonByt helps make that invisible cost visible.

By quantifying the impact of digital browsing, CarbonByt aims to:

Raise awareness of digital sustainability

Encourage optimization of websites for lighter footprints

Support eco-conscious browsing habits
